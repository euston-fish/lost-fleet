You are in command of a fleet of ships stranded in a hostile sector. With no backup
available, you must gather resources from asteroids to build the strength of the fleet
so it can defend itself in the event of encounters with hostile ships.

Your mission is to ensure the safety of the fleet while eliminating all threats in the area.
